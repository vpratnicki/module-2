# Vanessa Pratnicki Portfolio

## Project Description
Today, having an online portfolio is a necessity and a powerful tool to set yourself apart from others. Online portfolios are more personalized and more in-depth than a resume. They are a way to connect with potential employers and share your work with others in the industry. 

## Outcome
I am proud to reveal my first online portfolio built without the use of a content management system. I began the process first by sketching out a design and creating a basic layout of the page. Then I  created a wireframe of the page and organized each section into the containers that I will need to create to create in order for the site to function (see screenshot below). Next I created the basic frame work in HTML and then added the styling in CSS. I made sure to select a color pallet for the site and was consistent with styles and branding throughout. I have created an online portfolio that I will continue to update and will evolve over the years.
